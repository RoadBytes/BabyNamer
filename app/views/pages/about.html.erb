  <h1>We're having a baby girl!</h1>

  <p>So, to keep the large foot print of friends and family around the world
  together, I made an app: the <strong>Baby Namer 1800</strong></p>

  <p>Here you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a profile</li>
    <li>Suggest Names</li>
    <li>Vote Names Up or Down</li>
    <li>'Favorite' names and have them on your profile</li>
    <li>Comment on other People's Profiles and Suggested Names</li>
    <li>Create a request for other features</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'm hoping to stay connected, so don't hesitate to sign up and make a suggestion.</p>
